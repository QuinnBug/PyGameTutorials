PLEASE DO NOT PUSH TO MAIN -- FORK THE REPO OR CREATE YOUR OWN BRANCH BEFORE PUSHING

These are a bunch of files that i've created throughout all of our tutorial sessions. Feel free to pull them and look through some of the examples in there.

GameClasses.py and GameObjects.py are the files for the Pygame basic engine I've been fiddling with. If you want to try and make your own game with it feel free to look at SideScroller.py to see how i've set up a basic example. 

You can edit any of the files to your hearts content, but please do not push to main as that is the branch i'll be using to have a bse package for everyone to look at.
